# Cross section construction

This uses a strip of alternating trapezoids to construct a cross section of a truncated tetrahedron.

The trapezoids are of two different sizes.

The shorter side on the longer trapezoid has the same length as the longer side on the shorter trapezoid.

Both trapezoids have interior angles of 60 and 120 degrees.

_i wrote this forgetting that this means there are three lengths involved. this is just a first attempt and does not yet work._
