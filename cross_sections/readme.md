# Cross section construction

This uses a strip of alternating trapezoids to construct a cross section of a truncated tetrahedron.

The trapezoids are of two different sizes.

The shorter side on the longer trapezoid has the same length as the longer side on the shorter trapezoid.

Both trapezoids have interior angles of 60 and 120 degrees.

Appears to be working now. Refactored my multiproc scripts while applying them here.
